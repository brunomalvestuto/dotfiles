# DOTFILES

## Requirements
* oh-my-zsh

## Install

Fire up the commands from within your home folder

    git clone https://github.com/brunomalvestuto/dotfiles
    cd dotfiles; ./install

## Update

Sometimes I want to duplicate changes that I've made in another machine, to do so:
    cd ~/dotfiles; git pull && ./install
